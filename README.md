Background: The travel industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that has been greatly
influenced by the internet. With the rise of online booking platforms and the increasing use of
mobile devices, travelers are turning to websites and apps for trip planning, booking flights and
discovering activities. Traditional travel agencies are gradually losing ground to online platforms
due to the convenience, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility they offer to travelers.
Motivation: We will make a system that will show us a budget friendly trip plan. Because of
that any class of people can find their best trip with best cost. We can plan which place we will
visit, which hotel we will stay, which vehicle we need, everything we can select in one platform.
After completing all of our tour plan selection then we can see the best cost. Our system is all in
one platform where we can modify our trip plan.
Experience: In last semester we were work in IOT base project. A fire fighter robot. This robot
will go closer to fire and put water on the fire. Human can’t go so closer but this robot can do this.
By that human will be safe.
Another project is Auto motion delivery car. That’s work in restaurants serve food to the costumes
from the kitchen. It has it’s won map and marked table number to identify the destinations.
Another project is All pay. This a online mobile banking app. We just design that. There the
concept is this will create a combine platform where all the banking system will be here. By that
customer doesn’t need any others app to control their multiple banking system.
Another project is Telemedicine. There we provide all kind of health-related services like there
user can find near hospital list, Ambulance number, Clinic number, Doctors number, And similar
medicine name. The most main feature is there is a chatbot when you tell him your symptoms that
will find the name of the disease and recommend you the basic treatment but not any medicine.
